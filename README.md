# Road-Traffic-Accident-Analysis
Final project ICT-RTA data


Road traffic accidents are considered the most important general concern, as it results in numerous injuries and deaths worldwide. India is one among the developing nation which experiences the highest rate of such accidents. The effects of injuries and fatalities due to road traffic accidents have a tremendous impact on socio-economic development of a country.  Thus, we should concentrate the measures to reduce such accident severity in order to reduce the fatality rate.

   This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub city police departments which has been prepared 
   from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. It has 32 features 
   and 12316 instances of the accident. We have to identify major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.

I hope the data on road accidents and the basic analysis contained in this project will be useful in analysis of road safety issues leading to appropriate actions to achieve reduction in road accidents and resultant fatalities.
